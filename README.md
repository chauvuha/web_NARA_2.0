# web_NARA_2.0
NARA is a website project that provides personalized and immersive career guidance in STEM subjects.
Our first version of NARA aimed at Vietnamese youth aged 16 to 30 including:
* High school, undergraduates (esp. frosh and soph) and students in vocational training who are interested in STEM career but do not know their exact fit yet
* Post-graduates who are looking for a change in career to STEM but do not know their exact fit yet
* Anyone who has not been able to find easily accessible sources of information in STEM career due to language limitation
* Anyone who is overwhelmed with too many sources of information and needs a one-stop shop that gives a general, clear and concise yet detailed pathway for their intended career
